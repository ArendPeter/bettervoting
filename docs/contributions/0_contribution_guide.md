# BetterVoting contribution guide

We're so excited you're interested in contributing! Here's how to get plugged in

1. [Join Equal Vote](https://equal.vote/join) : BetterVoting is a project of the Equal Vote Coalition, a nonpartisan 501c3 nonprofit. Joining will add you to the slack, and bring you in contact with your volunteer coordinator. 

1. [Setup BetterVoting Locally](contributions/1_local_setup.html) : Deploy the app to your local machine so that you can test your changes

1. [Grab an Issue](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/star-server/issues) : Items tagged as 'good first issue' are great places to start. You'll need triage access in order to self assign. Drop an email to arendpeter@equal.vote with your github username in order to get permissions.
